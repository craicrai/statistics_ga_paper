This very small project calculates statistics on a small dataset
containing two independent and three dependent variables.  Analyses:
two-way ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, t-tests.

## To repeat the calculation:

The Makefile contains a recipe to perform the calculation and plot
scatter plots for exploratory data analysis:

- `make analysis`
