## TO DO
* Write README
* License
* gitignore file

## Remember:
* Keep track of steps in Makefile


## 2019-04-10
* Finished up two-way ANOVA
* Print statistics results to results/statistics.txt

## 2019-04-09
* Started two-way ANOVA.  Got very low p-value.
* Plot data for exploratory data analysis, Ecorr, Epit and npit (scatter matrix figure)
* Did a lot of polishing of code to print out results nicely
* Renamed columns to make them compatible to Python names, necessary for being able to write formulae for statsmodels

## 2019-04-08
* Set up the project directory with the proper structure, i.e. data/, results/, doc/, src/, etc
* Wrote code for one-way ANOVA of Ga effect
* Create virtual environment with python3
* Create Makefile
* Wrote small script to calculate pitting overpotential

## Before 2019-04-08, Monday
* Wrote script to perform two-samples t-test on rod versus ribbon for each Ga content individually, for Ecorr and Epit.
* Arranged data properly for statistical calculations, i.e. one row corresponding to one experiment.
* Got Ecorr and Epit data from student.
